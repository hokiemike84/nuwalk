# nuwalk
An alternative to fiwalk that utilizes The Sleuth Kit to generate a DFXML for file information

## Usage
Nuwalk is a python script that operates off of a TSK sqlite database.  The database can be generated using tsk_loaddb.exe from The Sleuth Kit https://www.sleuthkit.org/.  It is recommended that tsk_loaddb.exe be ran with the -h option to include md5 hashes.
Nuwalk will query file data from the database generated by tsk_loaddb.exe to build a DFXML similar to those produced by fiwalk.
The resulting DFXML can be fed into Bulk Extractor's identify_filenames.py script to provide location information for the features produced by Bulk Extractor.

```
python nuwalk.py <path to tsk database file> <output xml file name>
```
